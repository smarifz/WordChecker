// The LinkedList class is a generic class that stores a singly-linked list
// of "E" objects, where "E" can be replaced by any kind of object.  As with
// the ArrayLists you've used in the past, you'll be able to specify what
// kind of object is contained within each of your LinkedLists by putting a
// particular type in angle brackets; for example:
//
//     LinkedList<ForwardingEntry> entries = new LinkedList<ForwardingEntry>();
//
// I've provided you with a skeletal version to get started.  You may find
// that you're not calling all of these methods in your program.  That's okay;
// you may find these methods useful in future projects.

	// ought not to be manipulating nodes.  It is static because nodes need not
	// know anything about the list that they're a part of.

	// An iterator is an object that allows access to each of the elements
	// in a collection (such as a linked list) without requiring knowledge
	// of how the collection is implemented.  In the case of our LinkedList
	// class, an iterator would allow you to write a loop that ran through
	// all of the elements in the linked list in order, without having an
	// understanding of nodes, next references, and so on.
	//
	// The Iterator class here is public, because we want code outside of
	// the LinkedList class to be able to use it.  It is non-static, because
	// it is important for iterators to know something about the lists
	// that they iterate over.
	//
	// The proper way to use an Iterator from outside of the LinkedList
	// class is something like this:
	//
	//     LinkedList<String> list = new LinkedList<String>();
	//
	//     // code that adds a bunch of elements to the list
	//
	//     LinkedList<String>.Iterator iterator = list.iterator();
	//     String s = "";
	//
	//     while (iterator.hasNext())
	//     {
	//         s += iterator.next();
	//     }

		// is called on an iterator, the first element of the list is returned;
		// the second time next() is called, the second element is returned;
		// and so on.
		//
		// If there are no more elements in the list, a NoSuchElementException
		// should be thrown.  You generally won't want to catch this exception,
		// because it's an indication of a bug in your program; best to let
		// the program crash (with useful information about where the crash
		// occurred) so you can find and fix the problem.
